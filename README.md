This is a GPU accelerated implementation of the chaos game algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game)

The algorithm generates a fractal by generating billions of stoachistically generated points inside of a regular polygon. 
Each pixel in the resulting image has brightness coresponding to how many points ended up in that region.
The pixel that was hit the most is colored black, and then each other pixel is colored proportionally to the most-hit pixel.

The points are generated by starting at the center and repeatedly jumping halfway from its current position to a randomly
chosen vertex. 
At 25 jumps per pixel, the application can generate ~800 million points per second with a gtx 1080 Ti.
